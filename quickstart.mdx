Want to see what Easel can do? Let’s build your first app — from prompt to preview — in just a few minutes.


## Interface Overview

<Frame caption="Easel's 'New Project' screen. Your existing projects appear in the sidebar.">
  <img src="/images/quickstart/overview-example-1.png" alt="New project screen (light mode)" className="block dark:hidden rounded-xl border" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/overview-example-1-dark.png" alt="New project screen (dark mode)" className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl border border-gray-500/50" />
</Frame>

To create a new project:
- Click the **plus (+)** or **New Chat** button in the left sidebar.
- Your previous projects will also appear there.

<Tip>
You can collapse or expand the sidebar by clicking its edge or pressing <span className="inline-block font-mono bg-gray-500/10 px-1 rounded-md">⌘+B</span> (Mac) or <span className="inline-block font-mono bg-gray-500/10 px-1 rounded-md">Ctrl+B</span> (Windows).
</Tip>


<Frame caption="Easel's chat interface: messages on the left, your app on the right.">
  <img src="/images/quickstart/chat-example-1.png" alt="Chat interface (light mode)" className="block dark:hidden rounded-xl border" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/chat-example-1-dark.png" alt="Chat interface (dark mode)" className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl border border-gray-500/50" />
</Frame>

Once inside your project, you'll see:
- the **Chat History** on the left — your prompts and Easel’s responses
- the **Workbench** on the right — live preview and editable code

This is where the magic happens.


## Writing Your First Prompt

The key to great results with Easel is writing a clear, detailed prompt.  

<Tip>
Here’s an example of a strong first prompt:
```text
Create a landing page for an ultra-modern SaaS product called "FounderMeet":
- The page should include: hero section, features, pricing, and a call to action.
- Use brand colors: #f90f09 and #1a1a1a.
- Design style: modern and clean, similar to Linear or Notion.
- FounderMeet helps startup founders find co-founders via skill-based video matchmaking.
- It should look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
```

</Tip>

Feel free to reference websites, color codes, or app behavior — the more context, the better.


## Previewing Your App

Once Easel finishes generating, your preview will appear in the workbench automatically.

<Info>
It may take a few seconds for the preview to load.  
If it doesn’t appear within 30 seconds, try refreshing the page.
</Info>

You can continue chatting to update the UI, add logic, or make design changes.

## Making Changes and Adding Features

There are two ways to make changes:

1. Chatting with Easel
2. Editing the code directly

<Warning>
Knowing how to code is helpful, but **not required**. Easel is designed to be easy to use even if you don't have any coding experience.
</Warning>

### Chatting with Easel

In the chat window, you can ask Easel to make changes to the app. The same guidelines apply to chatting as they do to writing prompts:

- Be specific about what you want to change
- Provide as much context as possible

After you make a change, Easel will generate a new preview.

### Editing the code directly

In the workbench, you can edit the code directly. In the workbench header, choose the **Code** tab. Here, you can view all the files in your project, and edit the code in the file you want to change.

## Deploying

Right now, you can:

* **Export your code**
* **Deploy it anywhere** (Vercel, Netlify, your own server)

<Note>
Built-in one-click Easel deployment is coming soon — including support for custom domains.
