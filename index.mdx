## What is Easel?

Easel is a full-stack app builder powered by natural language. You describe what you want to build, and Easel turns it into working code â€” complete with components, logic, layout, and interactivity.

Whether youâ€™re a developer or youâ€™ve never written code before, Easel helps you go from idea to deployed app in minutes.

### The Core Workflow

<Tip>
  Easel is designed around a simple but powerful loop:
</Tip>

```text
Describe â†’ Generate â†’ Edit (optional) â†’ Preview â†’ Deploy (optional)
```

- **Describe** your app or feature in plain language.
- Easel **generates** the UI, layout, and logic instantly.
- **Edit** using the visual editor, the code view, or more prompts.
- See your app in the **live preview** as you go.
- When you're ready, **deploy** or export your code.

<Check>
  You can always switch between visual editing and code. And everything you see is real, editable code â€” no black boxes or hidden systems.
</Check>

### What can you build with Easel?

Easel can build landing pages, forms, individual components, apps, and more.
