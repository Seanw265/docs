## What is Easel?

Easel is a full-stack app builder powered by natural language. You describe what you want to build, and Easel turns it into working code â€” complete with components, logic, layout, and interactivity.

Whether youâ€™re a developer or youâ€™ve never written code before, Easel helps you go from idea to deployed app in minutes.

### The Core Workflow

Easel is designed around a simple but powerful workflow:

<div className="flex justify-center">
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'base',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#3b82f61a',
      'primaryTextColor': '#3b82f6',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#3b82f61a',
      'lineColor': '#1d4ed8'
    }
  }
}%%

  A(<span class="font-semibold">Prompt</span>) --> D(<span class="font-semibold">Preview</span>) --> E(<span class="font-semibold">Deploy</span>)
  D --> A
```
</div>

- **Describe** your app or feature in plain language.
- Easel **generates** the UI, layout, and logic instantly.
- **Edit** using the visual editor, the code view, or more prompts.
- See your app in the **live preview** as you go.
- When you're ready, **deploy** or export your code.

<Check>
  You can always switch between visual editing and code. And everything you see is real, editable code â€” no black boxes or hidden systems.
</Check>
