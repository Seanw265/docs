## Fast vs. Premium Messages

We offer two message types optimized for different tasks:

* **Fast Messages**: Quick, efficient, and powerful enough for many tasks, Fast Messages let you rapidly iterate, refine your apps, and experiment freely. Fast Messages reset daily.

* **Premium Messages**: Slower, smarter, and more capable, Premium Messages generate higher-quality results, more visually appealing designs, cleaner code, and better bug fixes. Premium Messages reset monthly.

Not every request needs a premium model. In fact, starting with a Premium Message and following up with Fast Messages is often a good strategy.

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Use a Premium Message for your **first request** in any project or chat that involves code generation. This sets a strong, clean foundation for Easel to work from. Then, try switching to Fast Messages for subsequent edits, tweaks, and iterations. This saves your Premium Messages for when you really need them.

**Fast Messages aren't cutting it?** Try a Premium Message for a stronger response.
</Tip>

## Message Limits by Plan

Here’s how message limits break down across Easel plans:

| Plan        | Fast Messages                 | Premium Messages |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Easel Free**    | 10 per day (30 max per month) | 3 per month      |
| **Easel Pro I**   | 75 per day *(no monthly cap)* | 30 per month     |
| **Easel Pro II**  | 75 per day *(no monthly cap)* | 75 per month     |
| **Easel Pro III** | 75 per day *(no monthly cap)* | 150 per month    |
| **Easel Pro IV**  | 75 per day *(no monthly cap)* | 300 per month    |

## Why Separate Fast and Premium?

Many tools limit your productivity: once you run out of messages, you’re stuck. Easel is different. By providing generous daily allowances of Fast Messages, you’re rarely out of options. Even if you exhaust your Premium Messages, Easel lets you keep going, iterating quickly, refining details, and making incremental improvements.

With Easel, **you always have room to experiment**, ensuring that your projects move forward without frustration.

<Info>
Our dual-message system means you're never completely stopped by message limits. Build, refine, and explore freely, knowing Easel has your back.

## Out of messages?

Upgrading your plan will increase your message limits.

## Upgrade your plan

Click on your avatar in the bottom left corner and select **Billing** or **Upgrade to Pro**. 

When you upgrade your plan, you will be charged immediately and the new plan will take effect right away. Message limits are updated after payment is processed.

## Downgrade your plan

When you downgrade your plan, your new plan will take effect at the end of the current billing period.

## Refunds

Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Due to the high cost of LLM usage, we generally cannot process a refund after messages have been used.
