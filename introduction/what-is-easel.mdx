<Note>
  Easel 2.0 is currently in early access. Some features like hosting, backend support, and team collaboration are coming soon.
</Note>

Easel is a full-stack app builder powered by natural language. You describe what you want to build, and Easel turns it into working code — complete with components, logic, layout, and interactivity.

Whether you’re a developer or you’ve never written code before, Easel helps you go from idea to deployed app in minutes.

## 🧠 The Core Workflow

<Tip>
  Easel is designed around a simple but powerful loop:
</Tip>

```text
Describe → Generate → Edit (optional) → Preview → Deploy (optional)
```

- **Describe** your app or feature in plain language.
- Easel **generates** the UI, layout, and logic instantly.
- **Edit** using the visual editor, the code view, or more prompts.
- See your app in the **live preview** as you go.
- When you're ready, **deploy** or export your code.

<Check>
  You can always switch between visual editing and code. And everything you see is real, editable code — no black boxes or hidden systems.
</Check>

### 🧠 What This Version Improves:

* **Uses Mintlify UI components** to visually organize information (`Tip`, `Note`, `Check`, `CardGroup`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`)
* **Scannable and engaging**, especially for newcomers or people comparing tools
* **Expandable** as new features go live (auth, Supabase, hosting, etc.)

Let me know if you'd like this copied into a Markdown file with frontmatter, or want a variation that targets a specific audience (e.g., developers only).
